I am building OmniFlow—a dual-vertical AI-powered consulting and automation platform for startups, founders, and SMBs. The business consists of:

OmniFlow Advisory: A live MVP consulting firm offering automated audits, workflow/process optimization, AI strategy, and retainer packages. Delivered via Bolt.new website, Tally forms, Notion CRM, and GPT-powered Zapier automations.

OmniCore (in development): A modular SaaS backend for deployable business automation agents, intelligent task routing, and a scalable dashboard, using Node.js, VS Code, OpenAI API, Replit, and Supabase.

Key strategic insights and priorities:

Service-to-SaaS funnel: Start clients with personalized consulting, then transition them to a self-serve automation platform for retention and scalability.

Modular automation blueprints: Productize common consulting flows (intake → audit → AI analysis → report → action) as reusable, customizable templates.

Agent middleware: Route requests to the best AI model (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.) and enable persistent agent/user memory.

Compliance-ready logging, versioning, and security.

Tiered monetization: Fixed-fee audits, retainers, outcome-based pilots (Advisory); subscription tiers, API/agent marketplace, white-labeling (OmniCore).

Target market: Solopreneurs, startups, SMBs, financial advisors, online brands, nonprofits, and agencies.

Risk mitigation: Redundant tools, live demo/onboarding, async workflows, modular backups, and ethical AI practices.

Industry best practices to incorporate:

Embed AI expertise and prompt engineering across the team.

Use AI for lead scoring, predictive analytics, and personalized engagement.

Automate workflows, onboarding, and support with AI agents.

Build for scalability, security, and compliance from the start.

Shift consulting focus from technical execution to strategic, relationship-driven advisory.

Instructions:

Review and build on top of my existing Replit MVP (AI-powered landing, intake, dashboard).

Propose and implement features that align with my strategic vision and industry best practices.

For each feature, briefly justify its impact on SaaS consulting growth, scalability, or client experience.

Suggest ways to iteratively test, validate, and refine features based on user feedback and analytics.

Provide code snippets, architecture diagrams, or user flows where appropriate.

Ask clarifying questions if more detail is needed before proceeding.

Output a step-by-step roadmap, prioritized feature list, and sample implementation plans.

Output format:

Step-by-step roadmap with justifications

Prioritized feature list with implementation notes

Sample code, diagrams, or user stories as needed
