You have already created a basic MVP for OmniFlow Advisory/OmniCore, featuring an AI-powered landing page, intake form, and a simple client dashboard. Now, build on top of this foundation and transform it into a scalable, modular platform suitable for both pro bono and paying clients. Please implement the following:

1. Modular Architecture & Scalability
Refactor the backend into modular microservices (e.g., user management, automation engine, analytics, agent orchestration) using Docker containers.

Add a service discovery mechanism and prepare for future Kubernetes deployment.

Integrate a persistent database (PostgreSQL or Supabase) with multi-tenant support and JWT authentication.

2. AI Agent Layer
Implement a middleware layer that can route requests to different AI models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, or local LLMs).

Allow for easy addition of new AI models and APIs in the future.

Add a basic agent memory system (using Redis or Supabase) to store user interactions and context for personalized experiences.

3. Automation Blueprint Library
Create a library of plug-and-play automation templates (e.g., intake → audit → AI analysis → report → Zapier action).

Allow users to browse, clone, and customize these blueprints from their dashboard.

Enable feature flagging so advanced templates are visible but locked for pro bono users.

4. Client Portal Enhancements
Add real-time project tracking, notifications, and collaborative tools (e.g., commenting, file uploads).

Integrate a feedback and support chat widget powered by an AI agent.

Provide a usage analytics dashboard showing automation runs, ROI estimates, and upgrade prompts for premium features.

5. Admin & Agent Ops Dashboard
Build an admin panel for monitoring agent health, error logs, user activity, and conversion metrics.

Include tools for managing automation templates, user roles, and feature access.

Add AI-powered recommendations for upselling and user engagement.

6. Monetization & Growth Features
Integrate Stripe (in test mode) for future subscription management and payments.

Implement tiered access: pro bono, professional, and enterprise, with clear upgrade paths.

Add referral and affiliate program logic for viral growth.

7. Security, Compliance, and Accessibility
Ensure all user data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

Add role-based access control and audit logging.

Make the frontend WCAG 2.1 AA accessible and fully responsive.

8. Developer & API Layer
Expose a RESTful API for third-party integrations and future marketplace features.

Include API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) and sample API keys for sandbox testing.

9. Documentation & Onboarding
Generate concise onboarding guides for both clients and admins.

Include in-app tooltips and a searchable help center.

Instructions:

Use Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

Use Express.js (or NestJS) for the backend.

Use Docker for containerization and prepare for future Kubernetes deployment.

Prioritize clean code, modularity, and clear documentation.

Provide sample test users (pro bono, pro, enterprise) for demo purposes.

Goal:
Deliver a robust, extensible MVP platform that can attract pro bono users, smoothly upgrade them to paid tiers, and scale to enterprise clients—while showcasing OmniFlow Advisory/OmniCore’s AI-driven consulting and automation strengths.
